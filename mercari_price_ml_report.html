<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-executive-summary">I. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The Mercari marketplace app is Japan’s most popular community-driven platform to buy and sell clothing, books, electronics, and collectibles. Listings contain structured fields (e.g., brand, item condition, shipping) and unstructured fields (e.g., name, description), making them ideal for a machine learning model that combines numeric, categorical, and text-derived features to predict prices. Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained using cross-validation on a resource-limited machine (8 GB RAM). Initial results showed Ridge Regression (root mean-squared log error (RMSLE) = 0.496) and XGBoost (RMSLE = 0.586) performed best. After hyperparameter tuning, Ridge Regression achieved the lowest RMSLE (0.496). Future improvements include additional features, more complex models, and training at scale. <br></p>

<section id="a.-dataset-description" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-dataset-description">A. Dataset description</h3>
<p>The training set comprises 1,482,535 rows and eight columns. Structured fields include <em>train_id</em> (integer identifier), <em>item_condition_id</em> (numerical category of product condition: 1 = new, 2 = fairly new, 3 = good, 4 = bad, 5 = very poor), <em>shipping</em> (binary: 0 = paid by buyer, 1 = paid by seller), and <em>brand_name</em> (categorical: name of the product’s brand). Text fields consist of <em>category_name</em> (hierarchical category information), <em>name</em> (product name), and <em>item_description</em> (product description). The target variable is <em>price</em> (numerical).</p>
</section>
<section id="b.-preprocessing-summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-preprocessing-summary">B. Preprocessing summary</h3>
<p><strong>Missing values:</strong> Only three columns had missing values: <em>brand_name</em> (632,682), <em>category_name</em> (6,327), and <em>item_description</em> (6). Roughly 57% of rows were complete, and no row had more than one missing value. <em>item_description</em> entries labeled as ‘No description yet’ were treated as missing and replaced with ‘No item description’, the same as true missing values. Missing <em>brand_name</em> and <em>category_name</em> values were replaced with ‘Unknown’ and ‘Unknown/Unknown/Unknown’, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Categorical mapping:</strong> <em>category_name</em> was split on ‘/’ into three hierarchical fields: <em>department</em> (11 categories), <em>category</em> (114 categories), and <em>class</em> (872 categories).</p>

<p><br> <strong>Target-mean encoding:</strong> <em>item_condition_id</em> was target-mean encoded due to its relationship with the target variable.</p>
<p><strong>Rare-label and target-mean encoding:</strong> Given the large numbers of categories in the four categorical fields (<em>department</em>, <em>category</em>, <em>class</em>, <em>brand_name</em>), the five most frequent known categories of each variable were retained while the remainder were binned into a single category, “Remaining.” Their relationships with mean log-transformed prices were visualized (<em>Fig. 2</em>), showing variability across categories per encoded variable and thus more potential features.</p>

<p><br> <strong>Boolean presence/absence:</strong> Boolean indicators were created to capture the presence of values in <em>category_name</em>, <em>brand_name</em>, and <em>item_description</em> (i.e., <em>has_cat_name</em>, <em>has_brand</em>, <em>has_desc</em>, respectively). Each feature was set to True when the corresponding field contained a known value and False otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Boolean keyword matches:</strong> Keyword groups from <em>item_description</em> (i.e., new, used, authentic, rare, set) were used to create Boolean indicators capturing item-specific characteristics relevant to pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining features:</strong> Structured features like <em>item_condition_id</em> and <em>shipping</em> were retained for modeling due to their clear interpretation and relevance to the target variable. <br></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-final-feature-set">A. Final Feature Set</h3>
<p>The final feature set combined <strong>deterministic</strong> and <strong>pipeline-dependent</strong> features, engineered manually or in-pipeline as needed. Ridge Regression used the 16 core features listed in <em>Table A1</em>, while Random Forest and XGBoost included these plus 5 additional pipeline-dependent transformations (<em>Table A2</em>), giving 21 features total. This conveys the dimensionality of each model: all share the same core features, with tree-based models expanded for one-hot or target-mean encoded top categories.</p>

<section id="b.-feature-engineering-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-feature-engineering-process">B. Feature engineering process</h3>
<p>Feature engineering was split into two phases: pre-pipeline and within the pipeline, ensuring consistency and preventing data leakage.</p>
<section id="pre-pipeline" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre-pipeline">1. Pre-pipeline</h4>
<p>Certain features were engineered outside the pipeline, as they were deterministic and independent of data distributions. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word counts and lengths</strong> for item names (<em>name_wc</em>) and item descriptions (<em>desc_len</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Boolean indicators</strong> marking the presence of data in specific fields, such as <em>has_cat_name</em></li>
<li><strong>Keyword-related indicators</strong> for clusters of terms in <em>item_description</em> (e.g., <em>has_keyword_new_like</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Log-transformation</strong> of the target variable (<em>price_log</em>)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="within-pipeline" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="within-pipeline">2. Within pipeline</h4>
<p>All data-dependent transformations were performed inside the modeling pipeline to prevent data leakage during cross-validation. These transformations included:</p>
<p><strong>Scaling and transformation of numeric features:</strong> <em>name_wc</em> was <strong>min–max scaled</strong>, while <em>desc_len</em> was <strong>log-transformed</strong> deterministically, with both processed together for consistent treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Text vectorization</strong>: TF-IDF was applied to <em>name</em> and <em>item_description</em>, with the number of features determined experimentally (e.g., 25,000 for <em>name</em>, 30,000 for <em>item_description</em> in Ridge Regression, and lower counts for Random Forest and XGBoost models for efficiency).</p>
<p><strong>Dimensionality reduction</strong>: For tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost), high-dimensional sparse matrices were reduced using <strong>Truncated SVD</strong> to ensure computational efficiency without compromising model performance.</p>
<p><strong>Categorical encoding</strong>: For Random Forest and XGBoost, the top 5 known categories of variables like <em>department</em>, <em>category</em>, <em>class</em>, and <em>brand</em> were <strong>rare-label encoded</strong> and <strong>one-hot encoded</strong> to reduce dimensionality. Ridge Regression used only <strong>target-mean encoding</strong> of the categories.</p>
<p><strong>Item condition handling</strong>: While Ridge Regression relied on the <strong>original <em>item_condition_id</em></strong>, both tree-based models benefited from <strong>target-mean encoding</strong> of this feature, in addition to retaining the original, improving performance without overfitting.</p>

<section id="c.-modeling-workflow" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-modeling-workflow">C. Modeling workflow</h3>
<p>Models were fit and tuned using cross-validation on the training set, split into three folds. The average RMSLE was calculated for each model. Initial configurations were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ridge Regression</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> values of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0.</li>
<li><strong>Random Forest</strong>: 50 trees, max depth of 10, minimum samples per leaf = 5, max features per split = square root of the total feature number</li>
<li><strong>XGBoost</strong>: Max of 100 trees, max depth = 4, learning rate = 0.2, subsample rate = 0.7</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ridge Regression model with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1.0\)</span> performed the best (RMSLE = 0.4959), while the Random Forest model had the weakest fit (RMSLE = 0.6342; <em>Table 2</em>).</p>

<section id="a.-key-takeaways" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-key-takeaways">A. Key Takeaways</h3>
<p><strong>Ridge Regression outperformed more complex models</strong>: Despite testing several algorithms, Ridge Regression with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 5.0\)</span> provided the best performance. This shows that simpler models, when well-tuned, can be highly effective in noisy and resource-limited environments.</p>
<p><strong>Text features were dominant</strong>: TF-IDF features from <em>name</em> and <em>item_description</em> contributed most to the top coefficients, significantly lowering RMSLE for Ridge Regression. This emphasizes the importance of thoughtful text preprocessing and feature extraction, even with limited compute resources.</p>
<p><strong>Non-text features showed strong predictive power</strong>: <em>name_wc</em>, target-mean encoded <em>category</em>, and <em>target-mean encoded </em>department* had the largest coefficients among non-TF-IDF features (absolute values &gt; 0.4). This demonstrates that structured metadata, like category and department, plays a key role in pricing models.</p>
</section>
<section id="b.-future-improvements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-future-improvements">B. Future Improvements</h3>
<p><strong>Refine feature engineering</strong>: Experiment with n-grams (bigrams, trigrams) for <em>item_description</em> to capture more nuanced product information.</p>
<p><strong>Explore brand–category interactions</strong>: Analyze finer-grained brand–category combinations to uncover patterns affecting pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Binning brands</strong>: Group brands into price tiers (e.g., high-end vs.&nbsp;budget) to better isolate pricing patterns.<br>
<strong>Experiment with more complex models</strong>: Advanced approaches such as LightGBM, stacked ensembles, or deep learning could improve generalization, especially with more computational resources.</p>
