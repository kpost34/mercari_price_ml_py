# **Mercari Price ML Project**
This project predicts item prices on the Mercari marketplace using structured metadata and unstructured text fields (item names and descriptions). Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, with a focus on balancing predictive performance and computational efficiency.

## Summary
Using a dataset of over 1.4 million Mercari listings, I engineered numeric, categorical, and text-derived features to predict log-transformed prices. Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation on a resource-limited machine (8 GB RAM). Despite its simplicity, Ridge Regression achieved the best performance (RMSLE = 0.496), outperforming more complex tree-based models. Results highlight the importance of text features and careful feature engineering in large-scale pricing problems.
